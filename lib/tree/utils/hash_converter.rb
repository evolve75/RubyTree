    # Factory method builds a {Tree::TreeNode} from a +Hash+.
    #
    # This method will interpret each key of your +Hash+ as a {Tree::TreeNode}.
    # Nested hashes are expected and child nodes will be added accordingly. If
    # a hash key is a single value that value will be used as the name for the
    # node.  If a hash key is an Array, both node name and content will be
    # populated.
    #
    # A leaf element of the tree should be represented as a hash key with
    # corresponding value +nil+ or +{}+.
    #
    # @example
    #   TreeNode.from_hash({:A => {:B => {}, :C => {:D => {}, :E => {}}}})
    #   # would be parsed into the following tree structure:
    #   #    A
    #   #   / \
    #   #  B   C
    #   #     / \
    #   #    D   E
    #
    #   # The same tree would result from this nil-terminated Hash
    #   {:A => {:B => nil, :C => {:D => nil, :E => nil}}}
    #
    #   # A tree with equivalent structure but with content present for
    #   # nodes A and D could be built from a hash like this:

  # (left and right child). It also provides direct access to the left or right
  # child, including assignment to the same.

  # This inherits from the {Tree::TreeNode} class.

    # level key of the input hash, to be inserted as children of the receiver
    # instance.

    # added accordingly. If a hash key is a single value that value will be
    # used as the name for the node.  If a hash key is an Array, both node
    # name and content will be populated.

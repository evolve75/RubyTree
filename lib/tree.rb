require 'tree/tree_deps'

# This module provides a *TreeNode* class whose instances are the primary
# objects for representing nodes in the tree.
#
# This module also acts as the namespace for all classes in the *RubyTree*
# package.
module Tree
  # == TreeNode Class Description
  #
  # This class models the nodes for an *N-ary* tree data structure. The
  # nodes are *named*, and have a place-holder for the node data (i.e.,
  # _content_ of the node). The node names are required to be *unique*
  # amongst the sibling/peer nodes. Note that the name is implicitly
  # used as an _ID_ within the data structure).
  #
  # The node's _content_ is *not* required to be unique across
  # different nodes in the tree, and can be +nil+ as well.
  #
  # The class provides various methods to navigate the tree, traverse
  # the structure, modify contents of the node, change position of the
  # node in the tree, and to make structural changes to the tree.
  #
  # A node can have any number of *child* nodes attached to it and
  # hence can be used to create N-ary trees.  Access to the child
  # nodes can be made in order (with the conventional left to right
  # access), or randomly.
  #
  # The node also provides direct access to its *parent* node as well
  # as other superior parents in the path to root of the tree.  In
  # addition, a node can also access its *sibling* nodes, if present.
  #
  # Note that while this implementation does not _explicitly_ support
  # directed graphs, the class itself makes no restrictions on
  # associating a node's *content* with multiple nodes in the tree.
  # However, having duplicate nodes within the structure is likely to
  # cause unpredictable behavior.

    # Convenience synonym for {Tree::TreeNode#add} method.

    # This method allows an easy mechanism to add node hierarchies to the tree
    # on a given path via chaining the method calls to successive child nodes.
    #
    # @example Add a child and grand-child to the root
    #   root << child << grand_child

    # This method can also be used for *grafting* a subtree into this
    # node's tree, if the specified child node is the root of a subtree (i.e.,
    # has child nodes under it).
    #
    # this node becomes parent of the node passed in as the argument, and
    # the child is added as the last child ("right most") in the current set of
    # children of this node.
    #
    # Additionally you can specify a insert position. The new node will be
    # inserted BEFORE that position. If you don't specify any position the node
    # will be just appended. This feature is provided to make implementation of
    # node movement within the tree very simple.

    #
    # This is to prevent +nil+ nodes being created as children if a non-existent
    # position is used.
    #
    # If the new node being added has an existing parent node, then it will be
    # removed from this pre-existing parent prior to being added as a child to
    # this node. I.e., the child node will effectively be moved from its old
    # parent to this node. In this situation, after the operation is complete,
    # the node will no longer exist as a child for its old parent.

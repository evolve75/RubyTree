# This module provides a TreeNode class which is the primary class for representing
# nodes in the tree.
#
# This module also acts as the namespace for all classes in the RubyTree package.
module Tree

  # == TreeNode Class Description
  #
  # This class models the nodes for an *N-ary* tree data structue. The
  # nodes are *named* and have a place-holder for the node data (i.e.,
  # _content_ of the node). The node names are required to be *unique*
  # within the tree (as the name is implicitly used as an _ID_ within
  # the data structure).
  #
  # The node's _content_ is *not* required to be unique across
  # different nodes in the tree, and can be +nil+ as well.
  #
  # The class provides various methods to navigate the tree, traverse
  # the structure, modify contents of the node, change position of the
  # node in the tree, and to make structural changes to the tree.
  #
  # A node can have any number of *child* nodes attached to it and
  # hence can be used to create N-ary trees.  Access to the child
  # nodes can be made in order (with the conventional left to right
  # access), or randomly.
  #
  # The node also provides direct access to its *parent* node as well
  # as other superior parents in the path to root of the tree.  In
  # addition, a node can also access its *sibling* nodes, if present.
  #
  # Note that while this implementation does not _explicitly_ support
  # directed graphs, the class itself makes no restrictions on
  # associating a node's *content* with multiple nodes in the tree.
  # However, having duplicate nodes within the structure is likely to
  # cause unpredictable behavior.
  #
  #
  # == Example
  #
  # The following example implements this tree structure:
  #
  #                    +------------+
  #                    |    ROOT    |
  #                    +-----+------+
  #            +-------------+------------+
  #            |                          |
  #    +-------+-------+          +-------+-------+
  #    |  CHILD 1      |          |  CHILD 2      |
  #    +-------+-------+          +---------------+
  #            |
  #            |
  #    +-------+-------+
  #    | GRANDCHILD 1  |
  #    +---------------+
  #
  #    # ..... Example starts.
  #    require 'tree'                 # Load the library
  #
  #    # ..... Create the root node first.  Note that every node has a name and an optional content payload.
  #    root_node = Tree::TreeNode.new("ROOT", "Root Content")
  #    root_node.print_tree
  #
  #    # ..... Now insert the child nodes.  Note that you can "chain" the child insertions for a given path to any depth.
  #    root_node << Tree::TreeNode.new("CHILD1", "Child1 Content") << Tree::TreeNode.new("GRANDCHILD1", "GrandChild1 Content")
  #    root_node << Tree::TreeNode.new("CHILD2", "Child2 Content")
  #
  #    # ..... Lets print the representation to stdout.  This is primarily used for debugging purposes.
  #    root_node.print_tree
  #
  #    # ..... Lets directly access children and grandchildren of the root.  The can be "chained" for a given path to any depth.
  #    child1       = root_node["CHILD1"]
  #    grand_child1 = root_node["CHILD1"]["GRANDCHILD1"]
  #
  #    # ..... Now lets retrieve siblings of the current node as an array.
  #    siblings_of_child1 = child1.siblings
  #
  #    # ..... Lets retrieve immediate children of the root node as an array.
  #    children_of_root = root_node.children
  #
  #    # ..... This is a depth-first and L-to-R pre-ordered traversal.
  #    root_node.each { |node| node.content.reverse }
  #
  #    # ..... Lets remove a child node from the root node.
  #    root_node.remove!(child1)

    RubyTree is a Ruby implementation of the generic tree data structure. It
    provides simple APIs to store named nodes, and to access, modify, and
    traverse the tree.

    The data model is node-centric, where nodes in the tree are the primary
    structural elements. It supports all common tree-traversal methods (pre-order,
    post-order, and breadth first).

    RubyTree mixes in the Enumerable and Comparable modules and behaves like a
    standard Ruby collection (iteration, comparison, etc.).

    RubyTree also includes a binary tree implementation, which provides in-order
    node traversal besides the other methods.

    RubyTree can import from and export to JSON, and supports Rubyâ€™s object
    marshaling.

    ========================================================================
                    Thank you for installing RubyTree.

    Note::
    - 2.1.1 is a minor update that updates all dependencies and
            Updates the guard clause for creating a tree from a hash.

    - 2.1.0 is a minor update that brings all libraries to their
            latest stable versions. This version no longer supports
            Ruby 2.6 (minimum requirement is now >= 2.7).

    - 2.0.0 is a major release with BREAKING API changes.
            See `API-CHANGES.md` for details.

    - `Tree::TreeNode#depth` method has been removed (it was broken).

    - Support for `CamelCase` methods names has bee removed.

    - The predicate methods no longer have `is_` or `has_` prefixes. However,
      aliases with these prefixes exist to support existing client code.

    - Use of integers as node names does not require the optional
      `num_as_name` flag.

    - `structured_warnings` is no longer a dependency.

    - Explicit support for rbx Ruby has been removed.

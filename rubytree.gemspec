    RubyTree is a pure Ruby implementation of the generic tree data structure. It
    provides a node-based model to store named nodes in the tree, and provides
    simple APIs to access, modify and traverse the structure.

    The implementation is node-centric, where individual nodes in the tree are the
    primary structural elements. All common tree-traversal methods (pre-order,
    post-order, and breadth-first) are supported.

    The library mixes in the Enumerable and Comparable modules to allow access to
    the tree as a standard collection (iteration, comparison, etc.).

    A Binary tree is also provided, which provides the in-order traversal in
    addition to the other methods.

    RubyTree supports importing from, and exporting to JSON, and also supports the
    Ruby's standard object marshaling.

    This is a BSD licensed open source project, and is hosted at
    http://github.com/evolve75/RubyTree, and is available as a standard gem from
    http://rubygems.org/gems/rubytree.

    The home page for RubyTree is at http://rubytree.anupamsg.me.
